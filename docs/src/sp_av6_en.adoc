== Arrays `[]`

=== Declaring arrays

[source,c]
----
type variable_name[SIZE];

int a[10];
float x[99];
char c[5];
----

=== Accessing array element

[source,c]
----
array[element_index];

int a[10];
a[0] = 1; // assigning value 1 of the first element
printf("%d", a[9]); // printing the value of the last element
----

== Problems

=== Problem 1

Write a program that for two arrays read from SI will check if they are equal. 
Print out the result from the comparison.
The maximum size of arrays is 100.

.Solution `p6_1_en.c`
[source,c]
----
include::{source_dir}/p6_1_en.c[]
----

=== Problem 2

Write a program that for an array read from SI, will compute the sum of even elements, the sum of odd elements and will compute the ratio even/odd.

.Example
For array:
`3 2 7 6 2 5 1`
The program should print:
----
Sum even: 8
Sum odds: 16
Ratio: 0.75
----

.Solution `p6_2_en.c`
[source,c]
----
include::{source_dir}/p6_2_en.c[]
----

=== Problem 3

Write a program that will compute the scalar product of two vectors with `n` coordinates. 
The number of coordinates `n` and the coordinates are read from SI. 
Print the result on the SO.

.Solution `p6_3_en.c`
[source,c]
----
include::{source_dir}/p6_3_en.c[]
----

=== Problem 4

Write a program that will check if a given array with `n` elements read from SI is ascending, descending or neither. 
Print the result.

.Solution `p6_4_en.c`
[source,c]
----
include::{source_dir}/p6_4_en.c[]
----

=== Problem 5

Write a program that will remove duplicate from an array. 
After the transformation print the array.

.Solution `p6_5_en.c`
[source,c]
----
include::{source_dir}/p6_5_en.c[]
----
